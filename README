README for simple-http

simple-http is a very simple http client, basing upon the linux/bsd sockets api.

Use the switch -h to get some help

You may use it as shown here:

	$ simple-http $SERVER $FILE
e.g.
	$ simple-http -6 lbo.spheniscida.de /index.php

simple-http terminates by itself when the server closes its socket if you don't stop it with SIGTERM.
